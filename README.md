The project encompasses a diverse range of captivating analyses, including the identification and examination of top movies, insights into movie runtime and IMDb ratings, exploration of language distribution, age group classifications, and evaluation of Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Through insightful visualizations and findings, this repository provides users with valuable information to facilitate their decision-making process when selecting a streaming service.

In the analysis of top movies, we delve into the most popular films available on each platform, allowing users to gain an understanding of the range of content offered by each app. Additionally, we explore the relationship between movie runtime and IMDb ratings, offering insights into how the duration of a film can impact its audience reception.

The examination of language distribution sheds light on the linguistic diversity present in the movie catalogs of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+. This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the languages represented, enabling users to discover movies in their preferred language.

Moreover, by categorizing movies according to different age groups, this project assists users in identifying age-appropriate content for themselves or their families on each streaming platform. This feature ensures that users can make informed decisions about the suitability of movies based on the intended audience.

Finally, we incorporate Rotten Tomatoes ratings to assess the critical reception of movies across the streaming apps. By comparing the ratings, users can gauge the overall quality and audience appeal of movies available on each platform.

In conclusion, this repository offers a comprehensive analysis of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+, highlighting their respective movie catalogs.
